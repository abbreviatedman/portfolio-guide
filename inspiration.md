# Inspiration

Here are some web dev portfolios you can look to as inspiration.

### Simple Portfolios

Simple doesn't mean plain, but it _does_ mean that the focus is on the content and the developer's work. These portfolios are clean, easy to navigate, and put the developer's work front and center.

It is a good idea to have a simple portfolio if you are just starting out. It is easy to maintain and update, and it is easy to navigate for potential employers.

### Complex Portfolios

Complex portfolios are more involved and can be more visually striking. They often include animations, interactive elements, and other features that make them stand out.

If you are more experienced and have a good grasp of web development, you can consider creating a more complex portfolio. Just be sure that the complexity doesn't overshadow your work. And remember that complex portfolios can be harder to maintain and update.

Even if you're able to create a complex portfolio, it's still a good idea to _start out_ with a simple one. You can always add complexity later, while if you focus on a complex portfolio from the start, you may find it overwhelming.

But even if you're not ready to create a complex portfolio, it can be helpful to look at these examples for inspiration!

### The Path To Your Portfolio

We'll get started with our portfolios shortly, but it's worth thinking about the path you'll take to get there. You do _not_ want to start by trying to create a complex portfolio. You'll want to start simple and build up from there.

A fantastic example of this is [Viktoria Bors-Pajuste's first version of her portfolio site](https://viktoria-b-pajuste.vercel.app/), which she's been kind enough to leave up. It's not particularly polished, but it's a great example of a a very good first draft. It has all the content you'd want in an initial draft, and while she's put plenty of work the design, she prioritized getting something reasonable up and running first.

She then went on to create a cleaner, more modern look, design, and page layout in [her current portfolio](https://www.viktoria-pajuste.hu/). You can see that the page is vastly improved. But, importantly, **she didn't start out spending time polishing her portfolio _before_ putting her work up.** She got something up and running, and _then_ she improved it.

You can read more about her process in [her blog post on investing in her portfolio.](https://dev.to/viktoriabors/why-i-decided-to-invest-in-my-portfolio-as-a-junior-developer-428p).

### Taking Inspiration

When you're looking at these portfolios, think about what you like about them. What do you think works well? What do you think could be improved? What elements do you think you might want to include in your own portfolio?

Remember that your portfolio isn't meant to be a perfect thing out of the box--take inspiration from these portfolios, but don't feel like you need to copy them exactly. Your portfolio should reflect _you_ and _your_ work, so make sure you're putting your own spin on things, and don't sweat it if your portfolio isn't as polished as the ones you're looking at. You can always improve it later!
